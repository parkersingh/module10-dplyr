# Exercise 6: DPLYR join introduction

# Install the nycflights13 package and read it in. Require the dplyr package.
# install.packages("nycflights13")



# Create a dataframe of the average arrival delay for each destination, then use `left_join()`
# to join on the "airports" dataframe, which has the airport info
avg.arr.delay.dest <- group_by(flights, dest) %>%
                      summarize(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
airport.avg.arr.delay <- left_join(airports, avg.arr.delay.dest, by = c("faa" = "dest"))

# Create a dataframe of the average arrival delay for each airline, then use `left_join()``
# to join on the "airlines" dataframe, which has the airline info
arr.delay.airline <- group_by(flights, carrier) %>%
                     summarize(avg_delay)

### Bonus ###
# Calculate the average delay by city AND airline, then merge on the city and airline information
